Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Java requires that each constructor has a unique set of parameters. This is known as constructor overloading.
In this case, both constructors have only one parameter, and both parameter types are string. Therefore, JAVA will not allow us to do this.
